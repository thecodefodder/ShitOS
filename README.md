# SkidOS

## What is SkidOS?

SkidOS is my attempt at making my own operating system.

## What is the goal of SkidOS?

Mostly just for fun, but I also want to learn more about operating systems and how they work.

## Is SkidOS a hobby project?

Yes, it is a hobby project.

## Can i use SkidOS?

Yes but no. Its a bear minimum operating system, so you can use it for whatever you want, but it is not meant to be used as a daily driver.

# Can i use SkidOS for my own project?

Abosolutely! I would love to see you use it but i must admit that it is not the best operating system to use for your own project. It is very bare bones and is not meant to be used as a daily driver. If you want to use it for your own project, please give me credit.
